# Single Cycle MIPS Processor
A simulation of the single cycle MIPS processor written verilog.  
A basic test bench and an advanced test bench have been created for this processor. The Basic test bench checks verifies if some specific instruction have been implemented and the advanced test benches generates 100 random numbers and sorts them using the instructions implemented.
