# Single Cycle MIPS Processor
A minimalist simulation of the single cycle MIPS processor written in verilog.  
A basic test bench and an advanced test bench have been created to test this processor. The Basic test bench checks if some specific instruction have been implemented and the advanced test benches generates 100 random numbers and sorts them using the instructions implemented.
Test benches can be run using softwares like modelsim.
## Implemented Instructions
#### R-Format: add, addu, sub, subu, and, or, xor, nor, slt, sltu
#### I-Format: addi, addiu, slti, sltiu, andi, ori, xori, lui, beq, bne, lw, sw
